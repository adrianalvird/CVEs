### Barracuda ESG Command Injection. CVE-2023-2868. CVSSv3 Score 9.8.
#### Vulnerability description.
A remote command injection vulnerability exists in the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (appliance form factor only) product effecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006. The vulnerability arises out of a failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape archives). The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker can specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product. This issue was fixed as part of BNSF-36456 patch. This patch was automatically applied to all customer appliances.The command injection vulnerability exists in the parsing logic for the processing of TAR files. The following code within the product is the focal point of the vulnerability:
`qx{$tarexec -O -xf $tempdir/parts/$part '$f'};`

### VMware vRealize Log Insight Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution. CVE-2022-31704, CVE-2022-31706, CVE-2022-31711. CVSSv3 Score 9.8.
#### Vulnerability description.
VMware vRealize Log Insights versions 8.x contain multiple vulnerabilities, such as directory traversal, broken access control, deserialization, and information disclosure. When chained together, these vulnerabilities allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user. This Metasploit module achieves code execution via triggering a RemotePakDownloadCommand command via the exposed thrift service after obtaining the node token by calling a GetConfigRequest thrift command. After the download, it will trigger a PakUpgradeCommand for processing the specially crafted PAK archive, which then will place the JSP payload under a certain API endpoint (pre-authenticated) location upon extraction for gaining remote code execution.
